# Step 1

First you want to create a GitHub account. Go onto your internet browser and search "Github." After finding the page, you want to click "Sign Up." 

# Step 2

After signing up you want to download Webstorm. So, open a new tab and download Webstorm's latest version. And save it into your files where you can access it anytime. 

# Step 3

Open up Webstorm and follow the instructions listed on the screen. 

# Step 4

In Webstorm, go to your Webstorm settings, where it says "System Preferences," and click "Git." After that, enter that path to the "git.exe." After this go to "Appearance and Behavior" in your settings and click, "System Settings." Than go to "Passwords" and set up a password and add a location for for the password file. 

# Step 5

After setting up Github password and Git in your Webstorm, Go back to the Github website, and you are going to "Create A Repository." This is where your saved project files and assignments are going to be when you "commit" your files from Webstorm. It's basically going to be transfered from Webstorm to Github. So, you go into your GitHub account and hit the plus ("+") sign. It will give you a drop down menu and you click "New Repository" after that. Than, after that is finished, you are going to want to name your repository. In my case I named it A03. Click "Public." and after that click "Add a README file."

Note: Name your repository file and name the Webstorm repository file the same because if not than you will NOT be able to upload your files and documents to your repository file on GitHub.

# Step 6

In Webstorm, Select "VCS" and import into Version Control. What this will do is create a Repository from Webstorm. After that, go to the main page on Webstorm where you will see your files, and Select "VCS" --> Checkout from version control and than click Git. You enter your local path name and URL in the two boxes on the screen. Your directory name will be the name of your repository in your Github account. For example: My repository in Github is "A03," so my directory name is going to be "/A03." After that click "Clone."

Note: To find the URL, you can go to your Github account, click the repository you used, For example: I used "A03." Go into your repository and click a green icon that says "Code." It will give you a drop down menu that shows you a URL. You copy that URl and paste it into the URL box in your Webstorm.

# Step 7

After completing Steps 1-6, everything should be set up. To verify that everything works, you should create an HTML file in your Webstorm. By clicking "File" in the top left corner, clicking on "New," and than "HTML file." Than name the file and after that, just add a random code and save it. Again, this is just to verify that it works. So, just add some sort of code. After that your file should be saved and added to Git. Now all that's left is to "commit" it to Github.

# Step 8

After that, select commit in the left left corner of your screen, it should be there sideways on your screen. And than select the files you want to upload to Github. And than add a commit message. And click "commit." After completing that, click "VCS," than "Git," and finally you click "Push." After that you can go to your Github account and go to your repository that you sent the file to. Refresh your page, and your file should be up there. 

After this, you have successfully, transfered your files via Webstorm to Github.
