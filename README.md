# Step 1

First you want to create a GitHub account. Go onto your internet browser and search "Github." After finding the page, you want to click "Sign Up." 

# Step 2

After signing up you want to download Webstorm. So, open a new tab and download Webstorm's latest version. And save it into your files where you can access it anytime. 

# Step 3

Open up Webstorm and follow the instructions listed on the screen. 

# Step 4

In Webstorm, go to your Webstorm settings, where it says "System Preferences," and click "Git." After that, enter that path to the "git.exe." After this go to "Appearance and Behavior" in your settings and click, "System Settings." Than go to "Passwords" and set up a password and add a location for for the password file. 

# Step 5

After setting up Github password and Git in your Webstorm, Go back to the Github website, and you are going to "Create A Repository." This is where your saved project files and assignments are going to be when you "commit" your files from Webstorm. It's basically going to be transfered from Webstorm to Github. So, you go into your GitHub account and hit the plus ("+") sign. It will give you a drop down menu and you click "New Repository" after that. Than, after that is finished, you are going to want to name your repository. In my case I named it A03. Click "Public." and after that click "Add a README file."

Note: Name your repository file and name the Webstorm repository file the same because if not than you will NOT be able to upload your files and documents to your repository file on GitHub.
